# 🔥 Jeopardy Spinoff
Welcome to **Jeopardy Spinoff** – a Jeopardy-style trivia game built with **React**, **styled-components**, and a reducer-powered state engine. This is a fully interactive, dynamic quiz experience that showcases clean architecture and thoughtful UX.

## 🎯 Highlights

- 🎮 **Jeopardy-Style Grid** – Interactive 4x5 board with category headers and click-to-play tiles.
- 🧠 **Context + Reducer State Engine** – Redux-style logic using `useReducer`, built from scratch.
- ✅ **Live Scoring System** – Tracks points in real-time based on correct answers and question values.
- ⏱️ **Answer Feedback** – Buttons flash green/red depending on correctness before continuing.
- 🔁 **Full Game Flow** – From start → play → finish, with a restart button at the end.
- ⚡ **Module-Level Data Caching** – Prevents unnecessary re-fetching of quiz data.
